How to generate the world?

Problems to be sovled:
    - Most things that generate in chunks will likely have blocks that bleed into other chunks, this makes generating chunk block data a little awkward.
        It will also not scale well for bigger and bigger structures.
    - Multiple chunks need to be generated at the same time in order to render in a timely fashion.
    - There needs to be an algorithm to generate the basic shape of the terrain.

Brainstorm:
    Maybe always generate the terrain in this fashion:
        1) Terrain Shape.
        2) Structures.
    But what about when multiple structures overlap?
        Maybe the order of the structures that generate and overwrite each other will be important.
        Possible order:
            1) Ores
            2) Caves
            3) Trees
            4) Foliage
            5) Structures (above and below ground)
        The structure overwriting will proceed from first to last.
            Making the last category the dominant structure.

Maybe for the issue of chunk generation, maybe creating a prebuilt map of what should be generated outside the current view of the player is the key.
    When creating chunks, that map will be referenced and the chunk will be created based on it.
    Maybe creating a map of the world not based on blocks will suffice.
        Instead, it would be based on objects in a scene.

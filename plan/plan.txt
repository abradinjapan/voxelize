Plan for world generation:
    World generation currently comes down to passing a function pointer to the generation algorithm and it being called later.

I need to solve the world generation problem BEFORE rewriting the chunk generation & rendering system to be multithreaded.

Note, do NOT change the world rendering system by removing chunk surfaces.
    They pose no real problem, they are just a little annoying, but they work just fine.



The unit of rotation used in rotation calculations should be radians.

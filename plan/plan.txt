As of right now, the following features must be implemented into voxelize:
    - Block placing and removing.
        Which Requires:
        - A world positioning system.
            Which Requires:
            - Global Coordinates.
            - Chunk Coordinates.
            - Block Coordinates.
        - A player position.
        - A player camera rotation & rotation based raycast.
        - A system to redraw chunks and chunk sides when blocks are changed.

There is one thing that I need to define in order to move forward.
    The unit of rotation used in rotation calculations.
        Let this be radians.

Player camera rotation and individual entity rotations need to be separated.

Chunk rendering must be based on a chunks global position and camera offset, no longer it's camera offset alone.
    This must be changed first before any other changes.

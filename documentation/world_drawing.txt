Coords Convention:
    Right:  X
    Left:  -X
    Up:    -Y
    Down:   Y
    Front:  Z
    Back:  -Z

Chunk buffer layout:
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex X Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex Y Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex Z Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Texture: Block Face Sub-Texture Numbers [u4: x, u4: y] ]
    u16: - [ Texture: Block Face Number [z] ]
    u16: - [ Reserved for future use (and because 32-bit numbers are the minimum in passing data from CPU to GLSL) ]

GUI buffer layout:
    u16: - [ Position: On Screen X Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: On Screen Y Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: Texture X Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: Texture Y Coordinate ]

Note:
    There are 3 coordinate spaces in this game for chunks.
    1) The world coordinates.
    2) The offset from camera coordinates.
    3) The in-chunk coordinates.
    In order to get chunk rotations to apply properly, rotation must be applied with the type 2 coords accounted for.
